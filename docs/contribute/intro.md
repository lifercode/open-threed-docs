# Introduction

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project! Any contribution you make will be reflected on [studio.threed.world](https://studio.threed.world).

Read our [Code of Conduct](https://threed.world/contribute/code-of-conduct) to keep our community approachable and respectable.

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## New contributor guide

To get an overview of the project, read this README. Here are some resources to help you get started with open source contributions:

- [Finding ways to contribute to open source on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/finding-ways-to-contribute-to-open-source-on-github)
- [Set up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)
- [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)
- [Collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests)

## Getting started

To navigate our codebase with confidence, see [the introduction to working in the threed-studio repository](/docs/contribute/working-in-studio-repository). For more information on how we use our code patterns, see [the threed-studio code pattern reference](/docs/contribute/code-pattern-reference).

Check to see what [types of contributions](/docs/contribute/types-of-contributions) we accept before making changes. Some of them don't even require writing a single line of code.

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem, search if an issue already exists. If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/open-threed/studio/issues/new).

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/open-threed/studio/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. As a general rule, we donâ€™t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Make Changes

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a working branch and start with your changes.
3. Commit your update and create a pull request for a review.

### Commit your update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them. Don't forget to self-review to speed up the review process.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
- Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
- Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.
Once you submit your PR, a Open ThreeD team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the PR. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

### Your PR is merged

Congratulations! The ThreeD Studio community thanks you.

Once your PR is merged, your contributions will be publicly visible on the ThreeD Studio.
