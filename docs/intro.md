# Getting Started
Build truly beautiful experiences on the web!

Threed Studio is a 3D animation editor with a set of design, lighting and motion tools. It helps you create any 3D scene, from a simple product presentation to a complete game made with Three.js.

Feel free to contribute or inspire yourself to build something out of it.

## Project
The goal is to incorporate all the editing capabilities provided by Three.js and its ecosystem into the editor's interface, granting users the freedom to accomplish practically everything they would be able to do if they were directly coding with this technology.

The product ought to have the capability to construct any 3D experiences on the web, leveraging Three.js exclusively for this purpose. I believe it would be splendid to fully harness the 3D modeling potential offered by this technology and bestow that very same power upon users through the editor tools.

Moreover, we aim to implement certain functionalities that streamline the creation of more complex things, such as character control in a third-person game or even scroll-based animations, ideal for crafting websites and web presentations.
